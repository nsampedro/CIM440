  <section class="intro">
   <p>The Earth is home to an abundant ammount of species. It would be impossible for us to know all of them that exist or have existed. The Map of Life is an interactie map that shows the locations of endangered animals that currently exist in the
    world. Each location of an animal is marked with a dark-grey circle that when you click on it shows you the endangered animal that is native to that area, a brief description of that animal, and an image of that animal. The animals chosen are
    some of the most endangered animals in the world, some are either considered critically endangered or on the brink of extinction. This map is created to show awareness to these animals that many people may not know of. In the descriptions for
    some animals, organizations were included that help in the rehabilitation of the population of these animals. You can donate to these organiations and help raise awareness to the cause. But a re-occuring reason for why these animals
    are going exting is due to loss of habitat. Meaning there homes are being destroyed by most times us humans. So hopefully by creating this map it makes people more environmentally aware of what it going on in there surrounding towards not just
    other humans but also the animals around them.
